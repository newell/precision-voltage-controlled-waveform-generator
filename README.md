# Precision Voltage Controlled Waveform Generator

This circuit is based off of an AOE (Art of Electronics, 3rd Edition) circuit example found on page 267 (Figure 4.83).

This circuit outputs triangle and square waves with frequencies equal to `200 * Vin Hz` where `Vin` is from `0` to `2*Vref`.  In this circuit `Vref` is `5 V` so we have a frequency range of `0` to `2 kHz`.
